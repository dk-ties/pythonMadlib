# pythonPlayground

My python playground repo.

This repo will I use to exsplore the python langues, by doing all kinds of project.
I will try to do as much by my self as possible, and dokumenting my project, with what Im trying to learn by doing the project.

Project I will try to do is inspiried by this freecodecamp guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/

The plan is to take inspiration of the described project, and do it my way. If I get stuck i will go in and do a overall reseash in each video.

I started this repo: 01-06-2023 - And my goal is to end it by the exit of 2023.

the 04-06-2023 I also started a blog, to document my journey from zero to actual Python programmer... You are more then welcome to step by and say Hallo.

#1 Project: Mad libs Python project.
My Idea:
Make a "chat robot" that will take a few input, and play around with them.
Indput: Name, Last name, Age, Profession
Output: Hello Full name, A pressention of the age and profession. Scamble name.

#2 Project: Guess the number (vs computer)
My Idea:
Create a small guess the number, just in terminal
Output some print,
Input a guess
Output if it correct, or needs to be warmer or colder.

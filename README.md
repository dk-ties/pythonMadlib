# pythonPlayground

My python playground repo.

This repo will I use to exsplore the python langues, by doing all kinds of project.
I will try to do as much by my self as possible, and dokumenting my project, with what Im trying to learn by doing the project.

Project I will try to do is inspiried by this freecodecamp guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-for-beginners/

The plan is to take inspiration of the described project, and do it my way. If I get stuck i will go in and do a overall reseash in each video.

I started this repo: 01-06-2023 - And my goal is to end it by the exit of 2023.

the 04-06-2023 I also started a blog, to document my journey from zero to actual Python programmer... You are more then welcome to step by and say Hallo.
